        <p><ol class="numbered-list">
          <li><span class="bold">Drop</span> - In the game, players can utilize the command <span class="bold">sdrop (or sd)</span> to drop a set of 3 random cards. This feature is designed to enhance gameplay dynamics by introducing an element of chance and strategy.<ul>
    <li>The<span class="bold"> sdrop</span> command can be executed every <span class="bold">8</span> minutes. A cooldown timer is initiated to maintain game balance and to prevent subsequent uses or more generally is a "time-out feature" to set limits on gambling activities. </li>
    <li>The dropper has <span class="bold">drop priority</span> meaning others who grab the same card get 100% blocked and has no chance of getting that card for a certain amount of time.</li>
    </ul>
<div>Apart from the player drops, there are server drops as well. These depend on how active the server is in which Sofi is in. The three server drops below:</div>

<div class="img-about">Type the captcha below the image to claim. It is not case sensitive. Captcha cards appearances depend on how active a Players server is. Though you better be fast incase it's a card you want (Beware of vultures).</div>

<div class="img-about">Three different series will be dropped for voting, players can cast their vote on one series. After a 30 second voting period, two cards from that series will drop. These do not have drop priority, so all players have an equal opportunity to grab them.</div>

<div class="img-about">One card will drop behind six hidden options. Only one of six options contains the card. Players have one chance to select from the six options to claim the card. Like everything about Sofi, this minigame is about chance and luck.</div>
</div>
    </li>
          <li><span class="bold">Grab</span> - In the game, players can acquire cards from a drop by using the designated numbered buttons. This feature allows for quick and strategic card collection, adding an interactive element to gameplay.</li>
    <ul>

            <li>Players can utilize the command <span class="bold">svote</span> to get the voting links and the player's progression towards the required number of votes per month.</li>
            <li>Voting is crucial in the Sofi game to earn rewards, specifically monthly chests. Players must accumulate a designated number of votes within the month to qualify for these rewards.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="general_info">
        <header class="header">General Info</header>
        <p>The following information serves as a foundational resource for players to enhance their understanding and gameplay experience. Players will acquire this knowledge through their engagement with the game mechanics and environments. This information is intended to provide context and insights that facilitate informed decision-making during gameplay.</p>
        <p class="code"><code>sburn or sburn [card code]</code></p>
        <p><img src="https://guide.sofi.gg/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fburn.28af5c03.png&w=640&q=75" alt="example of a card being burned and the rewards from it"></p>
        <p>The "Burning" process allows players to dispose of selected cards in exchange for in-game currency. This currency can subsequently be utilized for various purposes within the game. Players may initiate the Burning process on cards they have acquired by typing in <span class="bold">sburn(or sb) or sburn(or sb) [cardcode]</span>, effectively converting them into valuable assets for further gameplay advancements.</p>
        <p class="code"><code>Gen: G1-G2000</code></p>

          <td>G1000 - G2000</td>
          </tr>
          </table></p>
        <p>Cards that are generated (or "dropped" are assigned a generation(gen value). Each gen card generated within the system will have its gen value assigned within the definite range. Lower gen values indicate higher values for the dropped cards.</p>
         <p class="code"><code>slookup or slookup [card code]</code></p>
         <p><img src="https://guide.sofi.gg/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flookup.30391f91.png&w=640&q=75" alt="A picture of a character that was looke up"></p>
         <p>Lookup gives the player information about the character on the card, its versions and event versions. Players type in <span class="bold">slookup (or slu)</span> to look up the information. The information lookup provides:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>
            Series and Name of character
           </li>
           <li>
             How many wishlists the character has
           </li>
           <li>
             How many 2D versions the character has
           </li>
           <li>
             How many event versions the character has
           </li>
           <li>
             An image showing every 2D version
           </li>
           </ol>
           <p>Players can view every 2D version of the character by the "Version" button and every event version by the "Event" button.</p>
            <p>There are various methods players can utilize to find character information, for example players can do character lookup, series lookup, force search, and selection(from force search).</p>
          <p class="code"><code>swishlist</code></p>
          <p>The Wishlist feature enables players to indicate specific characters they are seeking. This functionality not only allows users to track their desired characters but also be able to get valuable insight in the character demands. The biggest features of Wishlist are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players can create and manage a list of characters they wish to acquire.</li>
            <li>The number of wishlists associated with a character serves as a quantitative measure of that character's popularity. This metric can influence the perceived value of the character card.</li>
            <li>Characters with higher wishlist counts may be viewed as more valuable due to increased interest from the community.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="code">
            <code>Guild</code>
            </p>
            <p>Players can make a guild of Sofi players that they regularly play together with. Guilds consist of four primary roles: <span class="bold">Founder, Guildmaster, Veteran, and Rookie</span>. Each role comes with specific permissions, with the Founder having the highest level of authority, including full administrative capabilities. The Guildmaster with a second authority level, and Veteran/Rookie having no authority level. Promotion within these roles should be approached carefully.</p>
            <p>Guilds begin at Level 1 and can earn experience points (XP) through various activities. Upgrading the guild requires XP and enables additional features. Member capacity can also be expanded over time, allowing for more players to join. Guilds participate in seasonal competitions, where they are ranked based on performance in raids. Each season consists of active gameplay periods followed by a grace period, during which rankings are not updated.Guilds can purchase and upgrade various boosts that enhance performance in quests and crafting. Each boost requires a specific amount of resources and offers unique benefits, contributing to overall guild efficiency.</p>
            <p>
This general structure allows guilds to operate effectively, fostering teamwork and enhancing the gaming experience for all members.</p>

        <header class="header">Cosmetics</header>
        <div class="header2">
        <h2>Frames</h2>
        <p>Frames can be used to add a specialized border around a card. They are a lesser upgrade than a 3D, but players have the option to choose their frames for their card, it is also an alternative if the players specific card does not have a 3D.</p>
        <p>There are five types of frames players can aquire. They are, Official, Custom, Monthly, Limited, and Legacy frames. Players can lookup buyable frames by typing in <span class="bold">sframeshop</span> where two Official frames and six custom frames are rotated daily.</p>
        <h2>Morph</h2>
        <p>Morphs are customizable color filters applied to a card, allowing for a wide range of visual effects. These filters can subtly adjust hues, apply tints, or even invert colors, offering extensive possibilities for unique card appearances.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On 2D’s only the frame or the type color will be changed.</li>
          <li>On 3D’s the entire base card will change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Players can buy a random morph for 350 silvers using <span class="bold">smorph (or sm)</span>. Players can also undo the morph for 100 silvers using <span>sundomorph (or sum)</span>.</p>
        <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
        <p>Backgrounds are 3D-exclusive cosmetics that enhance the card by filling in its gaps. They can be accessed and viewed using their ID with the <span class="bold">sbackgroundshop (or sbgs, sbgshop)</span> command.</p>
        <p>Players can buy any background excluding Event Exclusive Backgrounds(only can be purchased when an event happens) by typing the command <span class="bold">sbuy( or sget)</span> and apply the background by the command <span class="bold">sbackground (or sbg, subg)</span></p>
        <h2>Glows</h2>
        <p>Glows are a premium cosmetic in Sofi that add a blurred glow effect around a selected card, excluding GIFs. To obtain a glow, users can either unlock one or purchase it through glow-selling services available in Sofi Cafe and other Sofi-playing servers.
Once unlocked, a glow requires recharging for continued use. Each recharge costs 65 gems, allowing for infinite recharges thereafter.</p>
<p>Normal glows cost 100 gems to unlock with the command <span class="bold">sunlockglow (or sug)</span> and once aquired players can use a glow by the command <span class="bold">sglow</span>. Players can also rename and undo a glow by the commands <span class="bold">sglowname and sundoglow</span>, respectively. A Super Glow is created by merging two glows, resulting in a gradient effect and a significantly brighter appearance. You need 2 available glows to merge for the Super Glow, which can be done with the <span class="bold">ssuperglow</span> command. All this will cost around 1000 gems.</p>
          <p>More details will be on the Official Sofi Guide website.</p>
